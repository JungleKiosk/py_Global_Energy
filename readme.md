# Linear Regression: Missing Data & Prediction Model

In this repository, we will explore the application of a linear regression model to address the problem of missing data in a dataset dealing with socio-economic indicators, the reference variables of this project will be related to global energy consumption.
Through this real case study, we will examine how to address the `missing data` challenge and create a reliable `prediction model`.

## Project Objectives

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the approach to building a linear regression model to address the problem of missing data, through a combination of theory and practice we will explore the following aspects:

1. **Introduction to Linear Regression:** We'll start with a brief introduction to linear regression, including the basics and its role in data analysis.

2. **Dataset Preparation:** We will explore the dataset related to socio-economic indicators and global energy consumption. We will address the missing data and learn how to deal with it effectively.

3. **Model Building:** We will use the `Scikit-Learn` machine learning library to build a linear regression model that can predict global energy consumption based on available socio-economic indicators.

4. **Model Evaluation:** We will evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics and analyze the results obtained.

5. **Extra Exercise:** At the end of the project, we will go through an extra exercise which will allow you to further consolidate your knowledge about linear regression and data analysis.
